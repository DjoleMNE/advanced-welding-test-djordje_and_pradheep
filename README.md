-   [ ] Git setup
-   [ ] Travis setup

## Introduction
This project deals with implementation of a cartesian trajectory controller on a youbot arm in order to pass the advanced welding test from RoboCup. The desired cartesian position is fed into the cartesian trajectory controller. The controller moves the arm in a smooth line motion to the pre-fed goal position. 

## Packages

*   ROS - The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms [1] 
*   KDL - The Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) develops an application independent framework for modelling and computation of kinematic chains of robots. [2]
*   mas_common_robotics and mas_industrial_robotics 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
*   Ubuntu 14.04
*   Ros Indigo
*   Orocos(KDL)

#### First dependency

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get your components running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the test in simulation

Explain how to run the test in simulation

### Break down into smaller steps

Explain what these components do and what the user should see when running them

```
Give an example
```

### And some other components

Explain what these components do and what the user should see when running them

```
Give an example
```

## Running on the robot

Add additional notes about how to run this on youBot
